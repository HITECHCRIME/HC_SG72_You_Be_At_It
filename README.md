## Lyrics

```

out to get yeah
fucking gonna write ya (up)
fucking get it right ya
fucking dead of blight ya (ey)
fucking dead yeah
there's nothing in the script
i'll write
nothing dead yet so don't
cross your eyes ya (trust your eyes)
just yet

get erased yeah
fucking get erased yeah
folding into rays yeah (falling into place)
fucking god fucking dead fucking lies
let it rise for days
feel obliged (like it's yours)
feel obliged

if i were to...
i'd get nothing done
(falling into place)

(let the life erase)
(folding into rays)
(falling from grace)
(breaking twin fates)
(twisting words like bends)
(trust your eyes)

nothing done
nothing in your head
fucking god
fucking dead


out to get yeah
fucking gonna write ya (up)
fucking get it right ya
fucking dead of blight ya (ey)
fucking dead yeah
there's nothing in the script
i'll write
nothing seen yet so don't
trust your eyes ya (trust your eyes)
just yet

get erased yeah
fucking get erased yeah
falling into place yeah
fucking god fucking dead fucking lies
let it rise for days
feel obliged (like it's yours)
feel obliged

if i were to...
i'd get nothing done
