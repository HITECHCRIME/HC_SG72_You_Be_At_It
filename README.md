## Lyrics

```

out to get yeah

fucking get it right ya
fucking dead of blight ya (ey)
fucking dead yeah
there's nothing in the script
i'll write
nothing dead yet so don't
cross your eyes ya
just yet

get erased yeah
fucking get erased yeah
folding into rays yeah
fucking god fucking dead fucking lies
let it (him) rise for days
feel obliged
feel obliged
if i were to...
i'd get nothing done
nothing done
(it's allright)

(falling into place)

(let the life erase)
(folding into rays)
(falling from grace)
(breaking twin fates)
(twisting words like bends)
(trust your eyes)

nothing done
nothing in your head
fucking god
fucking dead

fucking world of blight ya (ey)
fucking dead yeah
there's nothing in this world

nothing touched yet so don't
turn your eyes ya (close) (cringe)

falling into place yeah
fucking toss fucking breath fucking die
let them bluff for days
feel obliged (like it's yours)
feel obliged

if i were to...
i'd get nothing done
nothing done
(it's allright)
